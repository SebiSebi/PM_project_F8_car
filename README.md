Intro

This is the source code and other important files for the design of my remote controlled car. The structure of the **src**
folder is the following:
  *  /src/remote - the code that runs on the remote uC;
  *  /src/car - the code that runs on the car uC;
  *  /src/shared - code that is shared by both the car and the remote control;
